Novel Ideas:

1. Representation of incremental page rank with an spmspv operation instead of an spmv operation
2. Doing inplace incremental SpmSpV 
3. Doing inplace addition of sparse vectors as well

//TODO:
4. In a page rank matrix, since all the vals in a particular row are the same, we could represent it in an even more sparse format. where vals.size() == # of rows instead of # of zeros!!! Will this give us perf benefits though?
